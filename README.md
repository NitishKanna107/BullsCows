# Bulls and Cows
I made this game while reading the book Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition). I had never heard of Bulls and Cows until I came across the exercise section of this book. It looked like a really fun game to play and hence I decided to publish a version made completely by me. 

### How to play?
The rules are simple to understand and the program will tell them to you at the start. To start playing the game you must enter a seed (random number) for the randint() function to generate a secret four digit number. The number of guesses are unlimited and in order to win the game you must score 4 Bulls. If you feel its impossible to guess then enter -1 to reveal the secret code.

### Setup
- Clone this repository or download a zip and extract all files.
- Compile the program using any compiler that you like. 
- Use main.cpp if you want to play the number version
- Use main_str.cpp if you want to play the word version

>Note:- The header file std_lib_facilities.h comes along with the book PPPUC++ and contains utilities that assist novice programmers. The game uses certain functions like error() and keep_window_open() defined in the header file. Its totally fine if you do not want std_lib_facilities.h and are fine with writing your own error() and keep_window_open() functions.

### Conclusion
This project was made as a learning endeavor and to appreciate the book PPPUC++ written by Bjarne Stroustrap himself. I would recommend PPPUC++ to any novice programmer wanting to learn C++ along with some tips about developing quality software. 

I thank you for investing your time in exploring my project and playing the game. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some constructive feedback on how to better program in C++.
